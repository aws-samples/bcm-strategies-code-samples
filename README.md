# BCM Strategies in Public Cloud

This repository contains sample implementations of the following Business Continuity Management (BCM) strategies for IT service continuity in the public cloud:

1. **Backup and Restore**
2. **Pilot Light**
3. **Warm Standby**

These strategies are described and discussed in the paper "Implementing IT Disaster Recovery Strategies in the Public Cloud" by Michael Wahlers and Christian Sch√§fer. The repository aims to provide practical examples and code samples to help the BCM community understand, validate, and implement these strategies.

## Overview

- [**Backup and Restore**](./backup-restore/README.md): This strategy involves creating backups of data and applications, which can be restored in the event of a disaster. The sample implementation demonstrates how to set up backup and restore processes in the cloud.

- [**Pilot Light**](./pilot-light/README.md): In this approach, a minimal version of the application environment is maintained in the cloud, ready to be scaled up when needed. The sample shows how to set up and manage a pilot light environment.

- [**Warm Standby**](./pilot-light/README.md): This strategy keeps a scaled-down but functional version of the application environment running in the cloud, allowing for faster recovery. The sample illustrates the implementation of a warm standby environment.

Each strategy's folder contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions, failover scripts, and demonstration videos to help you understand and reproduce the implementations.

## Walktrough Videos
